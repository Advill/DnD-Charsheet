# WIP DnD-Charsheet
A Dungeons and Dragons character sheet application

## How it works
Reads a json file of spells/actions and displays it for the user. The user may
add new spells/actions or delete preexisting ones.

*temporary data (save files) are not stored in the repo, but will be created if
any data is saved*

## How to run it
install package dependencies through npm, then simply run

`electron .`
